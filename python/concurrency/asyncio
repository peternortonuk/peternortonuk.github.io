The clue is in the name. This library is perfect for **io bound** processes eg where the application has to wait for web requests, file system operations or database reads.  
  
### Coroutines
Generators yield values, pause and retain state. Coroutines are like generators, but in reverse. They are a member of the `awaitable` type and they consume data eg.  
```
async def foo():
   await asyncio.bar  
   return eggs
```  
so the `await` means that the code has to pause and wait for this line to complete, this is likely to be the IO bound step
... but the `async` before the function definition says that other processes can continue while this function works in parallel and `foo` is now a **coroutine object**.  
  
but now every function that calls this one must also `await`  
  
until we reach the **event loop** which looks like this  
`asyncio.run(main())`  
  
### Running asynchronously
  
`await async.gather(task1(), task2(), task3())`  
If these tasks are sleep tasks as per the RealPython example, they run on a single thread in Python but when they are handed to the operating system they are delivered in parallel. The natural extension is that outside of Python, in the real world, these tasks could be separate requests to a file system and a database and a website.
